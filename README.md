# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in C++.

## Description

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors." It allows a user to play against the computer by choosing one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer also randomly selects one of these options, and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game.

## Features

- User-friendly interface
- Randomized computer selection
- Score tracking
- Error handling for invalid user input
